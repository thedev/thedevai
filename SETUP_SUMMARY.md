# Gatsby Starter Project - Setup Summary

This document provides a summary of the Gatsby starter project that has been set up for GitHub Pages deployment.

## What Was Created

### Core Files
- **package.json** - Node.js project configuration with Gatsby 5, React 18, and deployment scripts
- **gatsby-config.js** - Gatsby configuration with path prefix for GitHub Pages
- **.gitignore** - Properly configured to exclude build artifacts and dependencies

### Source Files
- **src/pages/index.js** - Home page with welcome content
- **src/pages/404.js** - Custom 404 error page
- **src/components/** - Directory for reusable React components

### GitHub Actions Workflows
- **.github/workflows/deploy.yml** - Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages on push to main
- **.github/workflows/pr-check.yml** - Build and test PRs before merging

### Documentation
- **README.md** - Comprehensive guide with setup, development, and deployment instructions

## How to Use

### Development
```bash
npm install        # Install dependencies
npm run develop    # Start development server at http://localhost:8000
```

### Build
```bash
npm run build      # Build for production
npm run serve      # Preview production build locally
```

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

#### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
1. Merge this PR to the main branch
2. Go to repository Settings > Pages
3. Set source to "GitHub Actions"
4. The site will automatically deploy on every push to main
5. Site will be available at: https://thedev.github.io/thedevai/

#### Option 2: Manual Deployment
```bash
npm run deploy     # Deploy to gh-pages branch
```
Then set GitHub Pages source to deploy from the `gh-pages` branch.

## Key Features
- ⚡️ Gatsby 5 with React 18
- 📦 GitHub Pages ready with proper path prefix
- 🤖 GitHub Actions for automated deployment
- 🔒 Secure workflows with explicit permissions
- 📱 Responsive default layout
- 🎨 Easy to customize

## Next Steps
1. Customize the content in `src/pages/index.js`
2. Add more pages to `src/pages/`
3. Create reusable components in `src/components/`
4. Update site metadata in `gatsby-config.js`
5. Add Gatsby plugins as needed

## Security
- All workflows use explicit permissions to follow security best practices
- Dependencies are properly managed with package-lock.json
- .gitignore prevents committing sensitive or unnecessary files
